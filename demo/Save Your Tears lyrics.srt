00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:09,200
(Intro)

1
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:13,100
I saw you dancing in a crowded room

2
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,200
You look so happy when
I'm not with you

3
00:00:17,300 --> 00:00:21,300
But then you saw me, caught
you by surprise

4
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,200
A single teardrop falling
from your eye

5
00:00:26,300 --> 00:00:31,400
I don't know why I run away

6
00:00:34,400 --> 00:00:40,900
I'll make you cry when I run away

7
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:45,950
You could've asked me why
I broke your heart

8
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,800
You could've told me
that you fell apart

9
00:00:49,900 --> 00:00:53,700
But you walked past me
like I wasn't there

10
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:58,450
And just pretended like
you didn't care

11
00:00:58,500 --> 00:01:03,000
I don't know why I run away

12
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,300
I'll make you cry when I run away

13
00:01:14,700 --> 00:01:18,600
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay

14
00:01:18,700 --> 00:01:21,600
Save your tears for another

15
00:01:21,700 --> 00:01:28,900
Save your tears for another day

16
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:34,700
Save your tears for another day

17
00:01:37,000 --> 00:01:42,900
So, I made you think that
I would always stay

18
00:01:43,000 --> 00:01:46,600
I said some things that
I should never say

19
00:01:46,700 --> 00:01:50,600
Yeah, I broke your heart like
someone did to mine

20
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:55,500
And now you won't love
me for a second time

21
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,400
I don't know why I run away, oh, girl

22
00:02:03,300 --> 00:02:08,800
Said I make you cry when I run away

23
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:15,600
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay

24
00:02:15,700 --> 00:02:19,200
Save your tears for another

25
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:23,600
I realize that I'm much too late

26
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:26,800
And you deserve someone better

27
00:02:26,900 --> 00:02:32,000
Save your tears for another
day (Ooh, yeah)

28
00:02:34,900 --> 00:02:40,900
Save your tears for another day (Yeah)

29
00:02:46,100 --> 00:02:52,300
I don't know why I run away

30
00:02:52,700 --> 00:02:57,400
I'll make you cry when I run away

31
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:06,650
Save your tears for another
day, ooh, girl (Ah)

32
00:03:06,700 --> 00:03:13,600
I said save your tears
for another day (Ah)

33
00:03:15,700 --> 00:03:23,200
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

34
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:33,300
Save your tears for another day (Ah)

35
